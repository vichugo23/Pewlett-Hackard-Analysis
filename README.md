# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees by their title, 
and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
To begin with this assignment I was given 6 csv files filled with employee date. 
I used PGAdmin4 and PostgressSQL to create tables and organize the data to create new tables to only display the information that was needed to determine which employees qualify for the mentorship program.

First, I created a table where the count of all the employees that are retiring are shown and organized by the position or "title" that they have within the company. As you can see most of the employees retiring are the ones with the "senior" positions. As they have been in the company the longest.
