# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees by their title, 
and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
To begin with this assignment I was given 6 csv files filled with employee date. 
I used PGAdmin4 and PostgressSQL to create tables and organize the data to create new tables to only display the information that was needed to determine which employees qualify for the mentorship program.
